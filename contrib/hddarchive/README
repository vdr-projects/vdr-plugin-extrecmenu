The hddarchive feature of the extrecmenu plugin is similar to
the dvdarchive feature. Except that the recordings are moved to a
HDD and not burned to a DVD.
In my case, I have an external USB docking station for SATA HDDs in which
I plug in the HDD with the recording to play.


Installation
============

1. Copy the 'hddarchive.sh' to the same directory like 'dvdarchive.sh'
   (in Gentoo Linux it is /usr/bin/hddarchive.sh)
2. Copy the 'hddarchive.conf' to the same directory like 'dvdarchive.conf'
   (in Gentoo Linux it is located in /etc/vdr/)
3. Edit the 'hddarchive.conf'. MOUNTPOINT should be an existing path, in 
   which the HDD will be mounted.
4. Copy the script 'vdr_move_to_hdd.sh' to /usr/local/bin/
5. Edit /usr/local/bin/vdr_move_to_hdd.sh: check that ARCHIVEHDD is the same
   as MOUNTPOINT in 3.
   VDRSETTINGSFILE is the path to the gentoo vdr config file (/etc/conf.d/vdr).
   This is only used to get the envvar ${VIDEO}. Alternative, You can set
   VIDEO=... manually.
6. Add the content of ./reccmds/reccmds.custom.conf to Your reccmds.conf.  
7. Create a file hdd.vdr in the root direcory on each archive HDD (/hdd.vdr)
   The content is used to identify the HDD and should be unique.
   I have used 2 digits 01, 02... "99 harddisks ought to be enough for anybody" ;-)
8. If you use the "live" plugin you may want to patch it with
   ./patches/live-ArchiveHDD.patch to support the archive HDDs.
