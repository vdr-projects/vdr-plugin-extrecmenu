The reclist is independent of the extrecmenu plugin.
It's nothing else than a set of scripts to create a 'database' of all
recordings. And to create different user defined outputs of this DB.


Installation
============

1. Copy the include scripts to /usr/local/bin
2. Edit vdr_set_values_for_recording_lists.sh to meet Your needs.
   VIDEODIR should contain Your video directory (eg: /video)
   RECLISTDIR is the directory, the list will be created in
   RECLISTFILE is the filename of the list
   All other parameters are values to define the layout of the output
3. Edit Your commands.conf file:
   You may want to use ./commands/commands.reclist.conf as a starting point.
   Modify the path to vdr_get_recordings.sh and
   vdr_generate_recording_list.sh (if neccessary)

   
Explanation of the scripts
--------------------------
vdr_set_values_for_recording_lists.sh
    sets values to generate the list and to generate the user defined outputs
vdr_get_recordings.sh
    scans all recordings and calls 'vdr_add_recording.sh' for each recording
vdr_add_recording.sh
    calls 'vdr_create_recording_list_entry.awk' to create an entry for each recording
vdr_create_recording_list_entry.awk
    does the real work. It extracts the neccessary values out of info or info.vdr
    and stores them in the reclist. Currently these values will be extracted:
    Title, Genre, Country, Year, Length, Date, Size, Media, Path.
vdr_generate_recording_list.sh
    creates the user defined outputs of the list.
          usage: vdr_generate_recording_list.sh <type> <what>
             where   <type> = (title|genre|country|year|length|date|size|media|path)
               and   <what> = (all|head|tail)
    'all' shows all entries, 'head' shows the first n entries, 'tail' the last n entries
    where n id the LINES_PER_PAGE defined in vdr_set_values_for_recording_lists.sh
vdr_crop_output.sh
    is just a script for convenience. It can crop a lengthy output to the first/last
    LINES_PER_PAGE lines
