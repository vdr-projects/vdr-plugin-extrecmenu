Description:
This plugin provides a recordings menu enhanced with the possibility to
rename or move recordings.

Renaming:
Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Red'. Type in/edit the name. By
pressing 'Ok', the recording will be renamed with this name.

Moving:
Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Green'. Now you are in the base video
directory. You can browse the directories, the path to the selected directory
is shown at the title bar. By pressing 'Blue' you select this path for moving.

There is a patch for VDR in /patches for replacing VDR's recordings menu with
this plugin. You have to set the corresponding option at the setup menu of the
plugin!
