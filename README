Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin provides a recordings menu enhanced with the possibility to
rename or move recordings and directories. The display of recording date, time
and length is configurable. The plugin also handles archive dvd's of VDR
recordings (as known from the DVDArchive-patch for VDR).

Editing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Renaming: Press 'Yellow', then 'Red'. Type in/edit the name. By pressing 'Ok'
renaming will be executed.

Moving: Press 'Yellow', then 'Green'. Now you are at the base directory of the
/video-directory-hierarchy. 'Ok' opens sub-directories, with 'Yellow' you can
create new dirs. With 'Blue' moving to the selected dir will be executed.

Details: Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Blue'. In this menu you can
edit the lifetime and priority of the selected recording.

Sort recordings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are four options for sorting at the setup menu:
Sort recordings by:
- alphabet for main-, flexible for subdirectories
- date for main-, flexible for subdirectories
- alphabet for all directories
- date for all directories
Flexible means, if the directory name ends with "-",".","$" or "ª", the
recordings in this directory are sorted by name, else by date.


Archiv-DVD-functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burn the entire directory, that contains the recording, to a dvd and label it
with an identifier (a number or anything else). At least the *.rec-folder has
to be on the dvd, because the recording is identified by this. You can of
course burn more than one recording to a dvd.

Now you can delete the video data files (001.vdr, 002.vdr, ...) from your hard
disc. Leave the index.vdr and info.vdr at the dir. index.vdr is needed if you
want the length of the recording displayed. You can also use 'getlength' from
the tools/-directory to create a length.vdr, containing the length of the
recording. If you do this, you can also delete index.vdr.

Create a new file dvd.vdr, that contains the identifier of the dvd. If you now
call the plugin and select such a recording entry you are asked to insert this
dvd. It will be mounted by the plugin and the replay starts from the dvd. After
replay ends, the dvd is unmountet instantly.

You can also include normal video dvds to your recordings hierarchy. Create a
folder with the name of the dvd. In this folder, create another one with
following name scheme: DD-MM-YY.hh.mm.pr.li.rec. The letters have following
meanings: DD - day (01-31), MM - month (01-12), YY - year (00-99), hh - hour
(00-23), mm - minutes (00-59), pr - priority (00-99), li - lifetime (00-99).
(Example: 01-01-06.20.15.50.99.rec) You must use this name scheme, so that VDR
identifies the folder as a recording. Now create in this folder a file dvd.vdr.
The first column contains the dvd id, in the second column write 0000. This
identifies the dvd as a video dvd. If you now select such a recording in the
list you are asked to insert the dvd and after confirming this the dvd-plugin
is started to play the video dvd.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of the plugin itselfs is like any other plugin installation. In
addition you have to place the script 'dvdarchive.sh' from the
scripts/-directory within your $PATH (maybe adjust the permissions) for the
DVDArchive-patch functionality. See the top of 'dvdarchive.sh' for the
adjustments you maybe have to do.

Check the options at the setup menu of the plugin. They are self-explaining.

There is a patch for VDR in contrib/ for replacing VDR's recordings menu with
this plugin. You have to set the corresponding option at the setup menu of the
plugin!

There ist a patched TTF-Font for Enigma containing the dvd and alternative new
symbols. See this post at vdr-portal.de:
