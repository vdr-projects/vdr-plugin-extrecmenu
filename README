Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin provides a recordings menu enhanced with the possibility to
rename or move recordings and directories. The display of recording date, time
and length is configurable. Sorting by name or date is selectable for each
directory. If you use the PIN-plugin, the replay and editing of recordings is
protected. The plugin also handles archive dvds of VDR recordings (as known
from the DVDArchive-patch for VDR). This plugin extends VDR's '-r'-option with
messages for deleting, moving and renaming a recording.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of the plugin itselfs is like any other plugin installation. Check
the Makefile if you use the PIN-plugin. You have to place the script
'dvdarchive.sh' from the scripts/-directory within your $PATH (maybe adjust the
permissions) for the DVDArchive-patch functionality. See the top of
'dvdarchive.sh' for the adjustments you maybe have to take.

Check the options at the setup menu of the plugin. They are self-explaining.

There is a patch for VDR in contrib/ for replacing VDR's recordings menu with
this plugin. You have to set the corresponding option at the setup menu of the
plugin!

There ist a patched TTF-Font for Enigma containing the dvd and alternative new
symbols. See this post at vdr-portal.de:

Handling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Renaming: Press 'Yellow', then 'Red'. Type in/edit the name. By pressing 'Ok'
renaming will be executed.

Moving: Press 'Yellow', then 'Green'. Now you are at the base directory of the
/video-directory-hierarchy. 'Ok' opens sub-directories, with 'Yellow' you can
create new dirs. With 'Blue' moving to the selected dir will be executed.

Details: Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Blue'. In this menu you can
edit the lifetime and priority of the selected recording. Editing the details
of archive dvd entries is not possible, because this would change the name by
which the recording is found on the disc.

Sort recordings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All directories are sorted by date by default. To change the sorting, simply
press '0'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Archiv-DVD-functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burn the entire directory, that contains the recording, to a dvd and label it
with an identifier (a number or anything else). At least the *.rec-folder has
to be on the dvd, because the recording is identified by this. You can of
course burn more than one recording to a dvd.

Now you can delete the video data files (001.vdr, 002.vdr, ...) from your hard
disc. Leave the index.vdr and info.vdr at the dir. index.vdr is needed if you
want the length of the recording displayed. You can also use 'getlength' from
the tools/-directory to create a length.vdr, containing the length of the
recording. If you do this, you can also delete index.vdr.

Create a new file dvd.vdr, that contains the identifier of the dvd. If you now
call the plugin and select such a recording entry you are asked to insert this
dvd. It will be mounted by the plugin and the replay starts from the dvd. After
replay ends, the dvd is unmountet instantly.

You can also include normal video dvds to your recordings hierarchy. Create a
folder with the name of the dvd. In this folder, create another one with
following name scheme: DD-MM-YY.hh.mm.pr.li.rec. The letters have following
meanings: DD - day (01-31), MM - month (01-12), YY - year (00-99), hh - hour
(00-23), mm - minutes (00-59), pr - priority (00-99), li - lifetime (00-99).
(Example: 01-01-06.20.15.50.99.rec) You must use this name scheme, so that VDR
identifies the folder as a recording. Now create in this folder a file dvd.vdr.
The first column contains the dvd id, in the second column write 0000 (or
anything else, its only important that there is a second column). This
identifies the dvd as a video dvd. If you now select such a recording in the
list you are asked to insert the dvd and after confirming this the DVD-plugin
is started to play the video dvd.
