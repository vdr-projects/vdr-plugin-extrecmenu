Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin provides a recordings menu enhanced with the possibility to
rename or move recordings. The display of recording date, time and length is
configurable. The plugin also handles archive dvd's of VDR recordings
(as known from the DVDArchive-patch for VDR).

Handling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Renaming: Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Red'. Type in/edit the
name. By pressing 'Ok', the recording will be renamed with this name.

Moving: Select a recording, press 'Yellow', then 'Green'. Now you are at the
base directory of the /video-directory-hierarchy. 'Ok' opens sub-directories,
with 'Yellow' you can create new dirs. 'Blue' moves the recording to the
selected directory.

DVDArchive-patch functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burn the entire directory, that contains the recording, to a dvd and label it
with an indentifier (a number or anything else). You can of cource burn more
than one recording to a dvd.
Now you can delete the video data files (001.vdr, 002.vdr, ...) from your hard
disc. Leave the index.vdr and info.vdr at the dir. index.vdr is needed if you
want the length of the recording displayed. You can also use 'getlength' from
the tools/-directory to create a length.vdr, containing the length of the
recording. If you do this, you can also delete index.vdr.
Create a new file dvd.vdr, that contains the identifier of the dvd. If you now
call the plugin and select such a recording entry you are asked to insert this
dvd. It will be mounted by the plugin and the replay starts from the dvd. After
replay ends, the dvd is unmountet instantly.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of the plugin itselfs is like any other plugin installation. In
addition you have to place the script 'dvdarchive.sh' from the
scripts/-directory within your $PATH (eventualy adjust the rights) for the
DVDArchive-patch functionality.

For VDR running as a user the script is designed to use sudo. Therefor sudo has
to be installed on your system and configured to execute mount and umount
without asking for a password. If you run VDR as root, change the variables
MOUNTCMD and UMOUNTCMD at top of the skript. Furthermore you have to adjust the
variable MOUNTPOINT to the mount point of your dvd device is it is defined in
/etc/fstab.

Check the options at the setup menu of the plugin. They are self-explaining.

There is a patch for VDR in patches/ for replacing VDR's recordings menu with
this plugin. You have to set the corresponding option at the setup menu of the
plugin!
